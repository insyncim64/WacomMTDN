- Add NativeWindow support for event handling.

- For some reason, WTOpen fails about half the time.  Find out why.  
  You'll need to debug through the Wintab code

- Find out why WTInfoA(WTI_CURSORS, CSR_NAME, buf) returns "Puck".  Seems it should return "Pen".

- Check returned values from GetDeviceAxis() against Win32 version.

- Restore the HWND, HCTX and FIX32 structs - they're actually OK.

- Add description of wrapped Wintab functions.

- Add support for PACKETEX (WT_PACKETEX) extensions (see TabletControlsSample).

- TODO - Implement GetPacketDataRange()

- TODO - Implement GetPacketData for multiple packets.
